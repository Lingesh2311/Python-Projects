Kaggle Dataset - [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/fireball684/hackerearthericsson)

 Data have been extracted from a website that provides job reviews. The website wants to analyze texts and the corresponding rating that is provided by the user about startups. A research team wants to analyze the liability of the review. In other words, they want to verify whether texts correspond as the same as the score that is provided as the rating for a startup. This task helps the website to rank the user's reviews or ratings.

This is the pilot implementation for the original HR dataset.
