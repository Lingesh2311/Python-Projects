## Machine Learning Mini Project - Forest Covertype Classification

The goal of this project is to classify the forest cover type dataset that can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction/data)
The study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. Each observation is a 30m x 30m patch. You are asked to predict an integer classification for the forest cover type. The seven types are:

1. Spruce/Fir
2. Lodgepole Pine
3. Ponderosa Pine
4. Cottonwood/Willow
5. Aspen
6. Douglas-fir
7. Krummholz

The project includes the report that discusses about the insights that was developed while studying the dataset.

My contribution includes the analysis of the log transformation for feature engineering the data and finding any improvements in accuracy.

### Results:
The best average classification accuracy achieved was using Ensemble of decision trees which was around **80%**.
